You can use Portworx to provide docker volumes for Mesos and Mesosphere through Marathon. Portworx pools your servers' capacity and is deployed as a container. Mesosphere has been qualified using DC/OS 1.7.   Mesos has been qualified using Mesos 1.0.1.   Marathon has been qualified, using version 1.3.6.

The Marathon service maps options through the Docker command line to reference the Portworx volume driver and associated volume.

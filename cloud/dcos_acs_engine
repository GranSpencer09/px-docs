### Overview
The [Azure Container Service Engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine) (acs-engine) generates ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates for Docker enabled clusters on Microsoft Azure with your choice of DC/OS, Kubernetes, Swarm Mode, or Swarm orchestrators. The input to the tool is a cluster definition. The cluster definition is very similar to (in many cases the same as) the ARM template syntax used to deploy a Microsoft Azure Container Service cluster.

The cluster definition file enables the following customizations to your Docker enabled cluster:

choice of DC/OS, Kubernetes, Swarm Mode, or Swarm orchestrators
multiple agent pools where each agent pool can specify:
standard or premium VM Sizes,
node count,
Virtual Machine ScaleSets or Availability Sets,
Storage Account Disks or Managed Disks (under private preview),
Docker cluster sizes of 1200

### Step 1: Install `acs-engine` and `azure CLI`
Install and build the [`acs-engine` binary](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/acsengine.md)

From a Linux host:
* git clone https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine.git
* cd acs-engine
* ./scripts/devenv.sh
* make prereqs && make build
* curl -L https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCli | bash

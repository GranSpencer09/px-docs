Portworx provides scale-out storage for containers. Portworx storage is delivered as a container that is installed on your servers. Portworx technology:

* Allows data services to be driven by DevOps. 
* Provides container granular persistent data volumes.
* Provides enterprise grade production features such as container granular HA, snapshots, encryption and shared namespaces.
* Enables applications to run multi-cloud with any scheduler.
* Manages storage that is directly attached to servers, from cloud volumes, or provided by hardware arrays.
* Is radically simple.

**Try It Now!**
